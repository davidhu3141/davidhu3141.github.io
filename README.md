I use github to host some of my pages:

1. Startup page for my internet browser, *personal use*
2. A page to post my articles. (as blog) http://davidhu3141.github.io/anthology/

I'll do some coding to manage my blog, and log here.

# OpenzFunction

Drawing net for polyhedrons expressed by z = f(x, y)

So that you can make real 3D model for some mathematical 2D surface.

For example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidhu3141/OpenzFunction/master/Sample/Faked.jpg)

This is the 2-D Taylor's approximation of z = sinx * siny / 2, up to cubic polynomial.

I photoshoped the picture (*the darker part of the model isn't real*) since I only make half of the model. Finishing the whole model would take too much time.
